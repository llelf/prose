Italian verbs have a high degree of inflection, the majority of which
follow one of three common patterns of conjugation. Conjugation is
affected by mood, person, tense, number and occasionally gender.

The three classes of verbs (patterns of conjugation) are distinguished
by the endings of the infinitive form of the verb:

1st conjugation: -are (amare, parlare)

2nd conjugation: -ere (credere, ricevere)

-arre, -irre and -urre are considered part of the 2nd conjugation, as
they are derived from Latin -ere but had lost their internal e after
the suffix fused to the stem's vowel (a, i and u).

3rd conjugation: -ire (dormire)

3rd conjugation -ire with infixed -isc- (finire)

Additionally, Italian has a number of irregular and semi-irregular
verbs, including essere, avere, andare, stare, dare, fare, and many
others.

The suffixes that form the infinitive are usually stressed, except for
-ere, which is stressed in some verbs and unstressed in others
(e.g. vedere /ve'deːre/ vs prendere /'prɛndere/). A few verbs have a
misleading, retracted infinitive, but use their unretracted stem in
most conjugations. Fare comes from Latin facere, which can be seen in
many of its forms. Similarly, dire ("to say") comes from dīcere, bere
("to drink") comes from bibere and porre ("to put") comes from pōnere.
